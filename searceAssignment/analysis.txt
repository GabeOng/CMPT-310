I expected the greedy algorithm to perform better since the map isnâ€™t too blocked at the walls and 
most had straight paths except for one from each corner to each corner. 
For A* Step vs A* Turn, I expected using the cost function stepTurn would yield better results as it would ensure the algorithm minimised turns, 
which would help since the map had those straight lines to each corner for the most part.

When tested the results lined up with my expectations. 
Greedy corners drew mostly straight lines to each corner except for the right wall. 
A* StepCount had more turns in its path while changing the cost function to step turn eliminated nodes as options since its cost was too high.
