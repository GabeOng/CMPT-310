Each 'layer' might take longer than 1 second depending on the depth. At deeper depths for 5x5 especially there will be many different states that can be explored which will increase the search time drastically.
Secondly there may be states where AlphaBeta pruning is not possible. Pruining can drastically improve performance and when not possible substantial time is added.

To remedy this one could run the search algorithm asynchronously. The search algorithms would run while a timer keeps track of time. Before times up the timer will set a mutex so that the search algorithm will know when to trace back. At this point whatever depth the search is at will use an eval function to return a states value. The most important part to keep it undertime would be to determine when the timer should write to the mutex.
A boring remedy would be when the timer is up and search is not complete you can make a random move.
